## Description

The Museum Visitor is a game where the player has to move inside a room to reach different art pieces one after another. Once the player reached the art piece, a new one will appear in a random position inside the room. Every time the player gets to an art piece, it will start being followed by a museum staff.
The game ends whenever the player crashes against one of the four walls of the room, or against one of its followers.
